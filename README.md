Advanced Discord bot to automate new Member on-boarding.

## About

Work in progress, use with care ðŸ”¥

I am using it successfully for a couple years on my community servers now, however especially configuration simplification has missing features. You have been warned.

## Setup

It's recommended to use Docker and docker-compose to bring up the bot and its companion services.

- Copy `docker/docker-compose.example.yml` as `docker-compose.yml` to a directory of your choice and add your bot token in there
- Copy `docker/appsettings.Production.example.json` as `appsettings.Production.json` into the same directory as the compose file
- Run `docker-compose pull` to fetch the container images
- Run `docker-compose up -d igor-bot-app igor-bot-db` to bring the bot and database services online
  - Optionally you can simply run `docker-compose up -d` which will also start the MongoDB web UI, which you might not need running all the time

## Configuration

### Discord server preparations

As of the time of writing the bot doesn't have any server setup commands so some elbow grease is required to get it up and running ðŸ’ª No worries though, I've got you covered! Adjust your `appsettings.Production.json` with the values outlined below:

- Create a new Guild entry in the config file with your server's ID as the key name
- Set the `GuildId` config value to the same ID
- Add a "Lurker" role and copy its ID to the `StrangerRoleId` config value
  - This is the role new members should get assigned to get identified. More on that later on.
- Add a "Full Member" role and copy its ID to the `MemberRoleId` config value
  - This is the role that promoted/unlocked members will get assigned when approved by a moderator
- Create a new category "Newbies" and copy its ID to the `ApplicationCategoryId` config value
- (Optional) Add one ore more moderator role IDs to `ApplicationModeratorRoleIds` to give those power to kick, ban or approve new members
- Add a **private** channel for bot status messages and copy its ID to `StrangerStatusChannelId` config value
- Add a **public** channel for the welcome messages and copy its ID to `MemberWelcomeMessageChannelId` config value
