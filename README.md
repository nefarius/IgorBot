Advanced Discord bot to automate new member onboarding.

## Motivation

Discord's built-in anti-spam and moderation tools at the time of creation were insufficient to protect against mass joins of accounts that sit idle—only to eventually post spam and scam links. An onboarding questionnaire is an effective way to separate humans from bots, and it helps identify new members who genuinely care about joining for a cause rather than those who simply found a link.

## Disclaimer

I am using it successfully for a couple of years on my community servers now, however especially configuration
simplification has missing features. You have been warned.

## Prerequisites

- **Option A**: Enable `AutoAssignStrangerRoleOnJoin` in your guild config so Igor assigns the "Lurker" role to new
  members automatically. The bot needs the Manage Roles permission and its role must be above the Lurker role.
- **Option B**: Use another bot (Carl, MEE6, ...) that assigns the "Lurker" role to new members.
- **Option C**: Assign the "Lurker" role to new members manually to trigger onboarding.

## Setup

It's recommended to use Docker and docker-compose to bring up the bot and its companion services.

- Copy `docker/docker-compose.example.yml` as `docker-compose.yml` to a directory of your choice and add your bot token
  in there
- Copy `docker/appsettings.Production.example.json` as `appsettings.Production.json` into the same directory as the
  compose file
- Run `docker-compose pull` to fetch the container images
- Run `docker-compose up -d` to bring the bot and database services online

## Configuration

Configuration is **runtime-configurable** via Discord slash commands—no restart required. Guild config lives in MongoDB
and can be migrated from `appsettings` on first run (see below).

### Quick start with `/config setup`

After inviting the bot to your server, run `/config setup` in Discord ( Administrator permission required). This prompts
you for:

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `stranger_role` | Role assigned to new members before they complete onboarding | — |
| `member_role` | Role assigned when a member is promoted | — |
| `application_category` | Category where newbie channels are created | — |
| `stranger_status_channel` | Channel where application status embeds appear | — |
| `member_welcome_channel` | Channel where welcome messages for promoted members appear | — |
| `application_channel_format` | Format for newbie channel names (`{0}` = number) | `newbie-{0:D4}` |
| `newbie_welcome_template` | Welcome message template (`{0}` = member mention) | *(standard onboarding prompt)* |
| `member_welcome_template` | Welcome message for promoted members (`{0}` = member mention) | `Welcome {0}, enjoy your stay!` |
| `auto_assign_stranger_role` | Automatically assign stranger role when member joins | `false` |
| `idle_kick_minutes` | Minutes before kicking inactive strangers (`0` = disabled) | `0` |
| `honeypot_channel` | (Optional) Channel that bans users who post in it | — |
| `moderator_role` | (Optional) Role that can see and interact with newbie channels | — |

Use `/config view` to inspect the current configuration and `/config set` to update individual options.

### Optional: Initial config via appsettings

If `Bot:Guilds` is present in `appsettings.json` or `appsettings.Production.json`, guild configs are migrated once to
MongoDB on startup. (.NET uses colon-separated key paths for nested config, e.g., `Bot:Guilds` in appsettings.) Afterwards
all config lives in MongoDB. You can still add new guilds via `/config setup` in Discord.

### Discord server preparations

- Add a "Lurker" role and set it as `stranger_role` (or `StrangerRoleId` if using appsettings)
  - This is the role new members receive to be identified. More on that later.
- If using Option A (auto-assign): Set `auto_assign_stranger_role` to `true`. The bot needs **Manage Roles** and its
  role must be above the Lurker role in the server's role hierarchy. Enable the **Guild Members** privileged intent in
  the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) for your bot.
- Add a "Full Member" role and set it as `member_role` (or `MemberRoleId`)
  - This is the role that promoted members receive when approved by a moderator
- Create a category "Newbies" and set it as `application_category` (or `ApplicationCategoryId`)
- (Optional) Add one or more moderator role IDs via `moderator_role` or `ApplicationModeratorRoleIds` to give them the
  power to kick, ban or approve new members
- Add a **private** channel for bot status messages → `stranger_status_channel` / `StrangerStatusChannelId`
- Add a **public** channel for welcome messages → `member_welcome_channel` / `MemberWelcomeMessageChannelId`
